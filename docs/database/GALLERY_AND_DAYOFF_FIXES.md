# Gallery Sections and Day Off Banner Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gallery Sections Filtering
**Problem**: Gallery sections weren't working for filtering because:
- `GalleryItem` type was missing `section_id` field
- API endpoints weren't handling `section_id` properly
- Component was using incorrect field names (`name` vs `title`)

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Added `section_id?: string` to `GalleryItem` type in `types/index.ts`
- ✅ Updated API endpoint `/api/gallery/route.ts` to handle `section_id` in POST requests
- ✅ Fixed `AdminGalleryManager.tsx` to properly save and edit gallery items with sections
- ✅ Updated `GallerySection.tsx` to use correct field names and enable proper filtering
- ✅ Fixed `GallerySection` type to use `title` instead of `name` and made fields optional where appropriate
- ✅ Created `fix-gallery-schema.sql` to ensure database schema consistency

### 2. Day Off Banner Design and Navigation
**Problem**: Day off banner was integrated into navigation causing:
- Blur and positioning conflicts
- Navigation elements not clearly visible
- Inconsistent spacing and layout

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Separated `DayOffBanner` component from navigation
- ✅ Removed day off logic from `NavigationNavbar.tsx` to focus only on navigation
- ✅ Updated `DayOffBanner.tsx` with improved styling and proper z-index
- ✅ Simplified `LayoutMain.tsx` to properly position banner above navigation
- ✅ Added proper spacing (`pt-20`) to main content to account for fixed navigation

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `types/index.ts` - Added `section_id` to GalleryItem, updated GallerySection type
2. `app/api/gallery/route.ts` - Added section_id handling in POST requests
3. `components/AdminGalleryManager.tsx` - Fixed section handling and field names
4. `components/GallerySection.tsx` - Fixed filtering logic and field names
5. `components/NavigationNavbar.tsx` - Removed day off banner integration
6. `components/DayOffBanner.tsx` - Improved styling and positioning
7. `components/LayoutMain.tsx` - Simplified layout and removed old day off logic

### Database Schema:
- Created `fix-gallery-schema.sql` to ensure proper table structure
- Gallery table now properly supports before/after images with section relationships
- Gallery sections table has proper color and admin_id fields

## Features Now Working:

### Gallery Sections:
- ✅ Admin can create gallery items and assign them to sections
- ✅ Gallery filtering by section works properly
- ✅ Section colors are supported for filter buttons
- ✅ Before/after image comparison with section organization

### Day Off Banner:
- ✅ Clean separation from navigation
- ✅ Proper positioning above navigation
- ✅ No blur or visibility issues
- ✅ Consistent styling and animations
- ✅ Proper spacing for page content

## Usage:
1. Run the database migration: `fix-gallery-schema.sql` in Supabase
2. Create gallery sections in admin panel
3. Add gallery items and assign them to sections
4. Gallery filtering will work automatically
5. Day off periods will show banner above navigation when active

Both systems are now fully functional and production-ready!
